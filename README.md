# random_imdb

This is a quick and simple tool I made for our weekly quizzes.  This tool will scrape a random film from the Top 250 and provide details about the Date, Director, Key Characters and Actors.  It is very straightforward and requires no inputs.  Once again, any advice on improvements will be welcome!
